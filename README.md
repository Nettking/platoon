Platooning project

This repository contains several Python scripts that demonstrate computer vision techniques for lane detection and autonomous driving. The code uses the OpenCV library to process video frames and detect lane markings, and also includes a function for calculating wheel speeds based on the steering angle.

These scripts are intended as a starting point for further development of autonomous driving algorithms, and can be easily adapted and extended to fit different vehicle configurations and use cases.
